Dataset 1: 
From BEELINE Benchmark datasets,  4 curated datasets named GSD, HSC, VSC, mCAD was evaluated using the gold standard network. The benchmark datsets were evaluated on AUPR, AUROC, MCC, F1-Score.
The second dataset used is the HIV Dataset collected from CZ CELLXGENE Site : https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/126afc71-47fb-4e9d-8aaf-9d9f61e0ac77. 

Dataset 2: 
The dataset is evaluated on the following conditions:
1. HIV Vs Normal samples
2. HIV-Leishmaniasis Vs Normal samples
3. HIV-Visceral Leishmaniasis Vs Normal samples

The HIV dataset was analysed in the following steps :
1. Hub analysis
2. Interaction analysis
3. GeneMANIA guided comparison
